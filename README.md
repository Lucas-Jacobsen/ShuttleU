  ShuttleU is a mobile application that can be used for shuttle transportation at Grand Canyon University. The application will include three user interfaces within one app: one for the rider of the shuttle, one for the driver of the shuttle, and one for an administrator. Using Goggle Maps API to populate a mapview, a rider will be able to log in and view a real-time data and information about the active shuttles patrolling campus. The user will also be prompted to request a ride, where he or she can input the pickup and dropoff location along with the approximate time of the trip and it will be added to a queue for a driver to accept and start. The driver will be able to being a trip for a reservation or a non-predetermined trip along with viewing and editing the shuttles spesific logs. Once a driver starts a trip, a screen will show the current trip and its details, a map with directions for the driver to follow, and options to edit and change the trip. The admin will have the ability to edit the inventory of the shuttles, set the shuttles status', and view the logs of all of the shuttles. 

This project is created using React Native Expo, MySql database, and the Google Maps API.
